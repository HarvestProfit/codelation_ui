Description:
    If only providing the name, it will create a vue component in the
    general component folder with all JS, CSS, and HTML boilerplate.

    If providing a controller plus name like 'users/profile_component',  it
    will put the component in the controller's view directory

Example:
    rails generate ui:component <name>

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/application/components/<name>.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/components/<name>.scss
        app/views/vue_components/_<name>.html


    rails generate ui:component <controller>/<name>

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/<controller>/templates/<name>.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/<controller>/templates/<name>.scss
        app/views/<controller>/templates/_<name>.html
