Description:
    Generates the HTML, controller, routes, JS, and CSS for a page name.  If
    you provide a singular name, it will generate singular routes (meaning no
    index route and no ids in routes), plural names will general plural routes

Example:
    rails generate ui:pages <name>

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/<plural_name>/index.js *
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/<plural_name>/show.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/<plural_name>/edit.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/<plural_name>/new.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/<plural_name>/index.js *
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/<plural_name>/show.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/<plural_name>/edit.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/<plural_name>/new.js
        app/views/<plural_name>/index.html.erb *
        app/views/<plural_name>/show.html.erb
        app/views/<plural_name>/edit.html.erb
        app/views/<plural_name>/new.html.erb
        app/controllers/<plural_name>_controller.rb
        resources :<plural_name> || resource :<singular_name>
