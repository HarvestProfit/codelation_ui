Description:
    Generates the HTML, controller, routes, JS, and CSS for a page name.  If
    you provide a singular name, it will generate singular routes (meaning no
    index route and no ids in routes), plural names will general plural routes.
    Providing a path will create a single page in the controllers directory

Example (plural routes):
    rails generate ui:pages users

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/index.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/show.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/edit.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/new.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/index.scss
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/show.scss
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/edit.scss
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/new.scss
        app/views/users/index.html.erb
        app/views/users/show.html.erb
        app/views/users/edit.html.erb
        app/views/users/new.html.erb
        app/controllers/users_controller.rb
        resources :users

Example (singular routes):
    rails generate ui:pages user

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/show.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/edit.js
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/new.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/show.scss
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/edit.scss
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/new.scss
        app/views/users/show.html.erb
        app/views/users/edit.html.erb
        app/views/users/new.html.erb
        app/controllers/users_controller.rb
        resource :user

Example (individual pages):
    rails generate ui:pages user/password_reset

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/application/views/users/password_reset.js
        app/assets/stylesheets/application/views/users/password_reset.scss
        app/views/users/password_reset.html.erb
        get "user/password_reset", to: "users#password_reset", as: :password_reset
